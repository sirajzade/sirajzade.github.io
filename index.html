      <p>What is the goal of Natural Language Processing and how it effects our daily life</p>
      <p class="text-justify">As the name suggests Natural Language Processing is a field of study which deals with the processing or digital application of natural human language. If we put it into simple words, it is mostly about how to make computers to understand or to produce human language. NLP is wildly used in many applications on your computer or on your phone, in the tools like Siri or Amazon Alexa. Even your google assistant can understand your spoken commands. The field has a bright future because the langue is the best and the easiest way to for us humans to communicate. 
      So, what do we mean with natural languages? These are languages like English, French, German, Chinese and many others we use in day-to-day communication. It presents itself mostly in one of the two forms: first in the form of a spoken language which can also be recorded and secondly in the form of written language, like a text in internet or social media. Classically, the field of the study of languages is called linguistics. In fact, it has a tradition of more than two thousand years of research. Usually, linguistics is divided into the study of sounds called phonetics which investigates the smallest building blocks for a language called phonemes, the study of the meaning of words, also called Lexicology, the study of morphology which deals with the inner structure of words or how they change in order to express certain abstract categories like plural in nouns or past in verbs and into a study of syntax how for examples words can be combined in order to build valid sentences.

      <p>How does an ANN work under the hood mathematically and algorithmically?...</p>
      <p class="text-justify">This video gives a very simple and very basic introduction to Artificial Neural Networks. It is meant for people who have no background in Artificial Neural Networks or Deep Leaning, especially for the people from disciplines other than Computer Science like Humanities. The video walks you around the topics how to imagine a neural network as a function, how to calculate an error function in order to find the difference between the predicted value and taget label and how to implement it in python. In the video I also discuss briefly why it is a good idea to vectorise the inputs, because in the real life the many deep learning algorithms use operations from linear algebra in oder not only to make the calculations easier to understand, but also to improve the running time. I will create another videos explaining the perceptron algorithm with examples and the another one explaining how artificial neural networks with deep hidden layers work and how they can be trained with the usage of Gradient Decent. This video will give you already some of the terminology and basic ideas in order to dig to these topics.

      <p class="text-justify">This video tries to give an overview about artificial intelligence and its subfields. It shortly describes fields like data mining, text mining, digital humanities, natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, evolutionary algorithms and symbolic ai. The aim is to show the differences between those fields and their interaction.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">This video is a short description of the open toolbox Luna Corpus Tools. This tool is developed for working with minority languages. It was designed for creating extensive linguistic annotations with the help of graphical user interface. Annotations are created in the process of tokenisation, sentence splitting, normalisation, pos-tagging, morphological analysis, topic modelling and sentiment analysis.</p>

      <p class="text-justify">I earned my master’s degree in Computational Philology from the University of Würzburg (Germany) and my PhD in Digital Humanities from the University of Trier (Germany). Since 2012 I have been involved in different projects at the Universities of Trier and Luxembourg. I am interested in research on appling machine learning in different fields of Humanities. These could be big databases, corpora, portals or language corpora and big language models, especially the ones which were created with the help of the newest deep learning algorithms. </p>
